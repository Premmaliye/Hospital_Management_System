Hospital Management System – Java & MySQL

This project is a complete Hospital Management System developed using Java and MySQL. It is designed to manage daily
hospital operations with an easy-to-use graphical interface. The system is built using strong Object-Oriented Programming 
concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. The project contains different modules like 
patient management, doctor management, appointment scheduling, billing, and medicine records. Each module is implemented 
using separate classes to maintain clean structure and reusability.

The backend of the system is powered by a MySQL database, where the application stores all information related to patients, 
doctors, appointments, billing details, medicine stock, and user accounts. Java JDBC is used to create a secure and stable
connection between the application and the database. The UI is created using Java Swing (or JavaFX if used), allowing users
such as admins, doctors, nurses, and receptionists to interact with the system in a simple and intuitive way.

The project follows a clear folder structure where separate packages handle UI forms, models, 
controllers, and the database connection. The database file (hospital.sql) includes all required tables 
and can be imported directly into MySQL. After importing, the user needs to update the JDBC connection details 
(URL, username, password) in the project and run the main application file to start the system.

This Hospital Management System provides features such as adding and updating patient details, managing
doctor information, storing medicine records, generating bills, booking and cancelling appointments, and
viewing hospital statistics through a dashboard. It aims to provide a smooth and accurate workflow that 
reduces manual work inside a hospital environment.
